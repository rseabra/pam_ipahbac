AIX supports it's own two LDAP attributes, per user: one which lists hosts where the user is allowed to login, and another of hosts where he is forbidden to.

Solaris has just one, for allowed hosts.

Both are unmaintanable messes per user, not the elegancy of FreeIPA's HBAC controls, they both _miss_ the concept of flexible control of user access to hosts and services.

This is just a simple PAM module that aims to implement FreeIPA's HBAC for systems that don't support it, like AIX and Solaris, or for systems that want to support it without a full FreeIPA client stack.

The logo is a play with the concept of _plugging in the missing piece_.

**Building the PAM module**

To build, either use the build scripts or use these commands:

	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	sudo make install

Building in AIX is a very long story, I'll be adding the rpm SPEC but one basically needs to build a lot of dependencies before it may work, the usual source of RPMS for AIX doesn't do them well enough.

**Testing**

You can check sample.pam included for more details about configuring the module, but it's a bit like this:

	cat <<EOF > /etc/pam.d/ipahbac_test
	account    required     pam_ipahbac.so blameGetOpt -u YourSysAccount -b dc=your,dc=domain -P /etc/ldap.secret -l ldaps://ldap1/,ldaps://ldap2/..
	EOF

Options
-------
* blameGetOpt is only needed in GNU/Linux and AIX as getopt is expecting argv[0] to be the command. Not needed in Solaris, it works differently there. (Why use getopt?... well... why have the trouble of parsing options myself?)
* `-d level` is optional, the debug level (use a value greater than zero, although currently only has one debug level)
* `-D domain` is optional, and used to create the FQDN if the hostname is the short version (eg, a.b.c).
* `-b BASE` is mandatory, the IPA domain base (eg dc=a,dc=b,dc=c)
* `-u USER` is mandatory, an IPA sysaccount but only the uid value is needed, the rest is derived from the base
* `-p PASS` or `-P path` is mandatory, as you'll need the sysaccount's password. The second form reads the whole first line of bytes as the password, including newline if present
* `-l LDAPSERVERS` is mandatory, and comprised of a comma separated list of LDAP servers. Use URI's in GNU/Linux and AIX, **host:port in Solaris**. TLS is **expected and required**.
* `-k path` is mandatory **in Solaris**; it's the path to the NSSDB that OpenLDAP is using.
* `-x path` is an optional file with a line separated list of users who will be immediately accepted (useful for root and application accounts).

Status
------

| OS  | Status | Observations |
| --- |:------:| ------------ |
| Fedora 23 | Done | |
| Solaris 11.3 | Done | Remember to compile in 64 and 32 bits... |
| AIX 6.1/7.1 | Works | Still being tested. Compiles and validates when tested with SSH and the test program. I decided to not care about IDSLDAP and just use OpenLDAP, which is sort of a requirement for sudo with LDAP support anyway, so it will be there for sure |

These guides give brief overviews about PAM and how to write modules.  This is useful if you already have a little knowledge.
